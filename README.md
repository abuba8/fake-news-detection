## Description
In this project, two objectives were achieved, the first objective this to inspect the fake news data via deep exploratory data analysis. It helps to do a descriptive analysis and extract the best features as pre-processing of data. The second objective is extract features using different techniques such as N-gram, Tfidf, and Sequence \& Padding. Then, train them on multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
